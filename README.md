# Project 1

## Building

Command line:

* `make` to build. An executable called `hellothread` will be produced.
* `make clean` to clean up all build products except the executable.

VS Code:

* The default build task runs `make`.

## Files


* `hellothread.c` main program to lauch threads

## Data

_[Description of the main data used in the program. Just list the major
data structuresâ€”not every variable.]_

There is an 80x24 2D array of Booleans that represents the cells, in
row-major order. Additionally, there's a second parallel array used to
double-buffer during the next generation computation.

If an array element is True, the cell is alive, otherwise it's dead.

## Functions

_[This is a tree of functions and their short descriptions]_

* `main()`
  * `init()`
    * `life_init()`: Initializes the cell array to random 
      * `grid_alloc()`: Allocate space for the cell grid
      * `randomize()`: Randomize the contents of the cell grid
    * `display_init()`: Initializes the display
      * `clear_screen()`
  * `run()`: Main game running routine
    * `life_update()`: Update cell data
      * `update_cell()`: updates a cell based on its neighbors
        * `get_neighbor_count()`: counts neighbors for a cell
    * `life_get_cells()`: Get cell status
    * `display_update()`: Display cells
      * `home_cursor()`
    * `delay()`: Delay between frames
  * `life_shutdown()`: Call before destruction (currently unreachable)
    * `grid_free()`: Free cell grid memory

## Notes

_[Any additional notes, bugs, etc.]_

* `^C` to quit.
* `life_init()` should allow different kinds of initializations, not
  just random.
* UI could be added so the user could draw patterns.
* Maybe add some preprogrammed patterns, spaceships, etc.
* Bug: display totally messed up on screens smaller than 80x24
